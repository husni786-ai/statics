# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

This project is part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification.

## Files Included

- `mean_var_std_calculator.py`: Contains the function to compute mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum for a 3x3 matrix.

## How to Use

1. Pass a list of 9 numbers to the `calculate()` function.
2. The function will return a dictionary with the statistics computed across rows, columns, and the entire matrix.

## Example

```python
from mean_var_std_calculator import calculate
print(calculate([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]))
```
